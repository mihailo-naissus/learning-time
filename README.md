Language Learning Scheduler


This program helps language learners plan their study schedule by estimating the number of hours per day they need to study in order to reach a target language level by a given date. The program uses the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) to determine the number of hours required to reach each level.

How to Use
To use the program, enter the following command in your terminal:



python scheduler.py



Then, follow the prompts to enter your current level, target level, and target date. The program will then calculate an estimated number of hours per day that you should study in order to reach your target level by the target date. If the estimated number of hours per day is greater than 6, the program will print a message saying that your goal is not realistic. If the estimated number of hours per day is less than or equal to 6, the program will print a suggested study schedule that includes 5 days per week of consistent study, 1 day with 8 hours of study, and 1 day off.
