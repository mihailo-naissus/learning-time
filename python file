//This code defines a function estimate_time_to_level that takes as input a current language level,
a target language level, and a target date and returns an estimate of the number of hours per day
the user should study in order to reach the target level by the target date. The function first
determines the number of hours required to reach the target level by using the dictionary hours_per_level,
which maps language levels to the number of hours required to reach them. The function then calculates the number of weeks,
days, and years required to reach the target level based on the current date, target date,
and number of hours required. Finally, the function returns the number of hours per day the user
should study as the number of weeks required divided by the number of years required and divided by 5 (since there are 5 weekdays).//
